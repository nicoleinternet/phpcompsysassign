    <!-- About Us Section -->
    <section id="about-us">
      <h2>Who We Are ?</h2>
      <p>We’re four uni students — <strong>Mathew</strong>, <strong>Lachlan</strong>, and <strong>Arvin</strong> and <strong>CALE</strong> — who believe that the IT industry shouldn’t be confusing or unreachable. We created CLAM in 2025 with one simple goal: to connect passionate people with professional opportunities in tech.</p>
      <p>CLAM was built from scratch with love for design, code, and the thrill of solving problems. We're not a corporation. We're students, dreamers, builders — just like you.</p>

    <!-- Our Story Section -->
    <section id="our-story">
      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Four mates. One shared vision. In the middle of a coding lab session at Swinburne University, <strong>Arvin</strong> and <strong>CALE</strong> threw out the idea: “Why don’t we build something real?”</p>
      <p>Within days, <strong>Mathew</strong> and <strong>CALE</strong> was designing forms, <strong>Lachlan</strong> and <strong>CALE</strong> was perfecting layout flow, and Arvin and <strong>CALE</strong> was writing the first lines of HTML. We wanted a platform that didn’t just talk about careers — it would launch them.</p>
      <p>And that’s how CLAM Careers was born. A platform for students, professionals, and anyone who believes in the power of passion and tech. This isn’t just a project. It’s a movement. A spark for the next generation of builders, breakers, and believers and <strong>CALE</strong> .</p>
