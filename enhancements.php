            <h2>Call To Action Buttons and Classes</h2>
            <a href = "index.php" class = "cta-button">To Example üåê</a>
            <h3>Go Beyond</h3>
            <p>Call to action buttons and classes allow us to add extra interactivity to the site while keeping a distinguishable difference from other buttons</p>
            <h3>The Code</h3>
            <p>Due to the simplicity of the call to action buttons we used, the difference in the code is created using a class called cta-button. The classes allow us to make the buttons look different from the standard navigation buttons</p>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Call To Action Buttons (CTA Buttons) are buttons that push the user to make an action, some examples are "add to cart" in online stores or "follow" on social media</p>
        
            <h2>Emojis and Special Characters</h2>
            <a href = "index.php" class = "cta-button">To Example üåê</a>
            <h3>Go Beyond</h3>
            <p>Emojis allow us to give more meaning to the website without adding clutter or downloading more images</p>
            <h3>The Code</h3>
            <p>There is barely any additional code required for the emojis, they are already built in and just require the correct input</p>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Emojis at essence are a type of special character, special characters hold additional information that tells them how to display themselves</p>
